## Overview

This post compares BIOS/UEFI, MBR/GPT, and different file systems such as NTSF/APFS/EXT4/XFS/exFAT.

## Description

### Boot firmware: BIOS vs UEFI

| | | |
|:---|:---:|:---:|
| Boot firmware | BIOS | UEFI |

A boot firmware is stored in the motherboard; this firmware initializes the system devices, and then runs the boot loader that loads the installed OS. This firmware is known as the **BIOS (Basic Input/Output System)** or **UEFI (Unified Extensible Firmware Interface)**.

#### Boot stages

* System startup
  * identifies, tests, and initializes system devices (e.g., CPU)
* Boot
  * locates boot loader on boot deivces (e.g., HDD, USB, CD, etc.)
  * transfers control to the loaded sector
  * the boot program from the boot sector interprets the partition table
  * loads installed OS

BIOS and UEFI are not the same, but both do the same job; UEFI replaces the legacy BIOS.

### Partition table: MBR vs. GPT

| | | |
|:---|:---:|:---:|
| Partition Table | MBR | GPT |

First accessed on one of the boot processes of BIOS/UEFI when `"the boot program from the boot sector interprets the partition table."`

[Source](https://access.redhat.com/documentation/en-us/red_hat_enterprise_linux/6/html/installation_guide/sect-uefi-support-drives-x86#doc-wrapper), [Source2](https://texit.tistory.com/55)  

Reasons for MBR partition table:

* if you have an old system with BIOS
  * the legacy BIOS is unable to boot off of GPT-partitioned disks

Reasons for GPT partition table:

* if you have a modern system with UEFI
  * UEFI requires GPT on the system's boot drive
* if the drive is larger than 2TB

Differences:
| Partition Table | MBR | GPT |
|:---|:---:|:---:|
| # of partitions | max. 4 | max. 128 |
| max. storage | 2.2 TB | 9.4ZB |

### File system format: boot and data

| | EXT4 | XFS | APFS | NTFS | exFAT |
|:---|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|
| Linux | boot/data | boot/data | x[^1] | x[^1] | data |
| macOS | x[^2]  | x[^2] | boot/data | read-only[^2]| data |
| Windows | x[^3] | x[^3] | x[^3] | boot/data | data |

#### compatibility

#### RHEL

<https://access.redhat.com/articles/rhel-limits#file-systems-and-storage-limits-5>
<https://access.redhat.com/articles/3129891>

* EXT4
* XFS
* ~~BtrFS~~
  * It was fully removed in Red Hat Enterprise Linux 8.[^5]

#### macOS

* APFS
  * default for macOS 11 and later
* HFS+
  * default for macOS 10.15 and earlier

#### Windows

* NTFS
* FAT32
  * 4GB size limit for single files

### Label format

| | Linux | macOS | Windows |
|:---|:---:|:---:|:---:|
| Boot |  |  |  |
| Data | LVM |  | msftdata |

## Solution

How to convert partition tables, format file systems, and manage partitions will be covered in a separate post.
